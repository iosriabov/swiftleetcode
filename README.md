# iOS Interview Preparation
Curating all the resources **I refer to** for interview preparation. This is **not an exhaustive list** and you are free to add your suggestion to it. Thank you!

*Note: I have only interviewed with a single company [Apple] as of now. I researched a lot about iOS interviews in general, but my views may be biased, and may not be helpful for the dream company you are preparing for.*

You can find the list here - [iOS Interview Preparation](https://github.com/iosriabov/LeetCode-in-Swift/blob/master/iOS%20INTERVIEW%20PREPARATION.md)

# Premium Questions

Note - I'm currently not interviewing, so I don't have any incentive to buy the premium subscription. If you want me to cover LeetCode Premium questions, you can sponsor the project. Thanks!
