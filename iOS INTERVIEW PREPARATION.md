## Mock Coding Interview
[Pramp](https://www.pramp.com) is a great website to practice live interviews with peers.

I feel knowing how an techinal happens is really important. [abrar's](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCAjsH3UCJrd-xAfUBsB-dOg/videos?view=0&sort=p&shelf_id=2) videos helped a lot to understand what an interview expects from you in a technical phone screen.

## Free Resources  [Non-Affliation]

### Raywenderlich Swift Algorithm Club
It is a public repository that has algortihms and data structures in Swift, with explanations. You can find it here -> [Welcome to the Swift Algorithm Club!](https://github.com/raywenderlich/swift-algorithm-club)

### LeetCode
LeetCode is the best platform according to me for practicing these type of questions, especially if you want to code in Swift. The editor supports Swift 5.0.1 and I faced no problem with it.

IF you have less time and an interview coming up, you can buy the subscription for a month, to get access to the solutions.

## Paid Resources [Non-Affliation]

### [Cracking the Coding Interview Book](http://www.crackingthecodinginterview.com)
It is a nice book. You can either do the questions from this book or go through LeetCode. One big advantage of this book was the dedicated solution with explanation. And hints to solve a question, just like an interviewer may give you one.

### [Raywenderlich Data Structures & Algorithms in Swift Book](https://store.raywenderlich.com/products/data-structures-and-algorithms-in-swift)
This is a more comprehensive book with detailed explanation of data structures and algorithms in Swift.

### [Raywenderlich Data Structures & Algorithms in Swift Course](https://www.raywenderlich.com/977854-data-structures-algorithms-in-swift)
Really nice explanation of the data structures and algorithms in Swift.
